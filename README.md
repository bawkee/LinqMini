[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/LinqMini.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LinqMini/)

A (very) small set of some essential extensions for Linq, does not intersect with MoreLinq

Includes
- IsNullOrEmpty
- WhereNotNull ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- DefaultIfNullOrEmpty
- RecursiveSelect, a very efficient recurse selector
- StrictlyOfType which filters by exact type so boxed instances won't pass
